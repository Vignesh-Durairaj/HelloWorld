### My First project in GitHub

My very first **Java** project in GitHub, which mainly helps me to get to know more about the Git based version controlling.

The below are the set of items covered in this project

* Simple Java `Hello World` program
* A set of hands-on practices on `Java 8 Lambda expression`.
  * Added set of practice codes on `Method References`.
  * Utilization of static `utility methods` in lambdas
* A set of hands-on practices on `Java 8 Stream` operations.
