### My First project in GitHub

My very first **Java** project in GitHub, which mainly helps me to get to know more about the Git based version controlling.

The below are the set of items covered in this project

- Simple Java `Hello World` program
- A set of hands on practices on `Java 8 Lambda expression`.
  - Planned to have a set of practices code on `Method References`.
